# Linux guidelines

Linux is an Unix-like operating system consisting of free/libre and open source software (FLOSS). The Linux kernel was written by Linus Torvalds and the first release was in 1991 for the x86 platform. Since then, a big community rose around this project and it was ported to an impressive number of platforms.[^1] There are many variants of Linux available today due to the open nature of the development. While this greatly improves diversity it can also be a energy waste since there are many applications that basically do the same thing. A Linux distribution is a full Linux package (with many software and utilities) which can run or be installed on a computer.

In order to get familiar with Linux one must have access to a Linux distribution to work on. Due to the fact that there are many distributions available many users find it difficult to chose one distribution over the other. Each Linux distribution has its own [package manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) and utilities for handling the way software is installed/removed/updated.
